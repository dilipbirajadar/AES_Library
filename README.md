# AES_Library
This library does encrption and decryption just need to pass string with AESJava class if you want to Java language otherwise you can use kotline with AES.kt

# Overview

The AES Library does the following:

This library does encrption and decryption just need to pass string with AESJava class if you want to Java langauge otherwise
you can use kotline with AES.kt

# Java
- Implimentation in Java for encryption : AESJava.encrypt(stringToencrypt) 
- Implimentation in Java for decryption : AESJava.dncrypt(stringTodncrypt) 

# Kotlin
- Implimentation in Kotlin for encryption : AES.encrypt(stringToencrypt) 
- Implimentation in kotlin for decryption : AES.dncrypt(stringTodncrypt) 

# To achieve this, 
 - Designed AESJava
 - Designed AES.kt
 - Design the AES-SHA-256 Alogrithm for Encryption and Decryption
 - Pass String if you want use java then AESJava.class or if you want to use kotline then AES.kt class  



# Used Security 

- AES SHA-256 Alogorithm for encryption and decyption technique.

# Libraries
This app leverages android X.


# For Test App
Clone or Download from this repo.
Open downlaoded project in android studio and add to your project this dependancy and just run.
Pass which string you want to encrypt or decrypt.
